    "### Explanation:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "1. **Share the Secret:**  \n",
    "   - The function `share_secret` splits each bid into `num_shares` shares. The sum of these shares equals the original bid.  \n",
    "   - Each bidder's bid is split into shares and distributed among the parties.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Local Computation:**  \n",
    "   - Each party receives their corresponding shares from all bidders.  \n",
    "   - Each party computes the maximum of their shares.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Secure Maximum Computation:**  \n",
    "   - The function `find_max_bid` computes the maximum share for each party.  \n",
    "   - The maximum shares are then combined to reconstruct the final maximum bid.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Reconstruct the Secret:**  \n",
    "   - The function `reconstruct_secret` sums the maximum shares to obtain the highest bid.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Important Notes:  \n",
    "- This example is highly simplified and does not cover all security aspects required for a real-world SMPC system.  \n",
    "- In practice, more sophisticated protocols and cryptographic techniques are used to ensure security and privacy.  \n",
    "- This implementation assumes that parties will not collude and that the communication is secure.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "This basic implementation should give your students a foundational understanding of how SMPC can be used to compute the maximum bid among multiple bidders without revealing the individual bid values."
