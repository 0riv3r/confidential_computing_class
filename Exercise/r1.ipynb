    "How This Works:\n",
    "Secret Sharing: Each bid is split into multiple shares using additive secret sharing. The actual bid can only be reconstructed if all shares are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure Comparison: Instead of revealing the bids, we compute shares of the difference between bids. By summing these difference shares, we learn which bid was larger without learning the actual bid values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy: No single party has access to the complete bid values at any point. The computation works only with the shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "This is a simplified implementation for demonstration. A real MPC system would distribute computation across multiple parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using a trusted third party (the BidComparator class) which knows all shares. In true MPC, this would be distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For production use, you would want to use established MPC libraries like PySyft or frameworks like SPDZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to modify any aspect of this implementation or explain any part in more detail?"
