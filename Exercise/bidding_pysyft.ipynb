    "### Explanation:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "1. **Setting up the Virtual Workers:**  \n",
    "   - We create three virtual workers (`alice`, `bob`, and `charlie`) using `PySyft`. These workers will perform the secure computation.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Encrypting the Bids:**  \n",
    "   - Each bidder's bid is converted into a PyTorch tensor and then shared among the three workers using the `share` method. This method splits the tensor into shares and distributes them to the workers. The `crypto_provider` argument specifies which worker will act as the cryptographic provider.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Computing the Maximum Bid:**  \n",
    "   - The bids are stacked into a single tensor, and the maximum bid is computed using the `th.max` function. This operation is performed securely without revealing the individual bid values.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Decrypting the Result:**  \n",
    "   - The result of the maximum bid is decrypted using the `get` method. We also decrypt each individual bid to determine which bidder submitted the highest bid.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Important Notes:  \n",
    "- This code is for educational purposes and demonstrates the basic principles of SMPC using `PySyft`. In practice, additional security measures and optimizations may be necessary.  \n",
    "- Make sure that `PySyft` and its dependencies are correctly installed.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "This should give your students a practical understanding of how SMPC can be used to solve the problem of determining the highest bid among multiple bidders without revealing their individual bid values."
